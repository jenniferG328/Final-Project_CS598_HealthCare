## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The repo reproduces CASS: Cross Architectural Self-Supervision for Medical Image Analysis, a novel self-supervised learning approach that leverages Transformer and CNN simultaneously. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches, we empirically show that CASS-trained CNNs and Transformers across four diverse datasets gained an average of 3.8% with 1% labeled data, 5.9% with 10% labeled data, and 10.13% with 100% labeled data.



## 2. Dependencies  <a name="Dependencies"></a>
1. Create a python enviroment with `pytorch >= 1.8.1`.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## 3.Train and Inference  <a name="Train"></a>

To train the model and choose among different datasets, please refer to the **Draft_Training.ipynb**

To inference, please refer to the **For Inference and Test.ipynb** in the last section **Test**
